// STUB — required staging flow #16: Return a reservation (release the hold, inventory restored)

// STATUS: TODO (not yet authored). This spec is intentionally SKIPPED via
// test.fixme so it appears in the report as PENDING — it never silently passes.
//
// REASON: No return-reservation spec exists. Must assert the hold is released and inventory level restored — additive, never destructive to other tenants.
//
// Run with the staging config only (hard-gates the STAGING ref first):
//   PREVIEW_URL=... npx playwright test -c playwright.staging.config.mjs
