// STATUS: TODO (not yet authored). This spec is intentionally SKIPPED via
// test.fixme so it appears in the report as PENDING — it never silently passes.
//
// REASON: roles/roles.spec.mjs references the quality role; the QC checklist surface is unproven. Author a dedicated QC spec.
//
// Run with the staging config only (hard-gates the STAGING ref first):
//   PREVIEW_URL=... npx playwright test -c playwright.staging.config.mjs

    // When authoring: use helpers/session.mjs authedPage(browser, '<role>') for a
    // seeded HARDEN_TEST_ session, and helpers/staging.mjs assertStagingOnly(page)
    // to re-assert the STAGING ref inside the test.
