// STUB — required staging flow #2: Password change (must_change_password → set new password → re-login)
//
// STATUS: TODO (not yet authored). This spec is intentionally SKIPPED via
// test.fixme so it appears in the report as PENDING — it never silently passes.
//
// REASON: No dedicated spec exists. Requires a seeded user with must_change_password=true; the seeder currently sets it false, so a dedicated fixture user is needed before authoring.
//
// Run with the staging config only (hard-gates the STAGING ref first):
//   PREVIEW_URL=... npx playwright test -c playwright.staging.config.mjs
